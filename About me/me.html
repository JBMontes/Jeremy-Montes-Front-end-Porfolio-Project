            My name is Jeremy Montes. I am a web developer originally from Harlem, NY but now located in Newark, New Jersey. My journey into software engineering began after graduating college. As I was exploring my options towards a new career, I realized that the options available in my field were not going to give me the life I wanted to live.
            Given my passion for psychology and working as an EMT, I see that the resources available were limited to those who acted directly with facilities. Now in tech, it can widen the demographic scope of those that could be helped.
            I am currently working to understand how to incorporate a more fluid and safe environment for people struggling with mental health. I am passionate about science, gaming, and food. A cool fact about me is that I saved lives before I got into engineering.
