# Jeremy-Montes-Front-end-Porfolio-Project

Welcome to Yearly, the application that generates random yearly facts depending on the number.

As the page loads, there will be three cards with random facts. If the user is not satisfied with those, just click on the "More Facts" button to see more. 

Users also have the option of updating the facts section with facts of their own. Just fill out the "Update" form, press submit, and the update will be displayed. If the user is not satisfied with what was shared, a remove button is availble. 

For more information about the developer, click on the "About Me" down at the bottom of the page.
